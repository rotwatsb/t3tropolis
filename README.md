<h1>t3tropolis!</h1>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>Builds on rust nightly on linux and mac. Just make sure you have freetype and cmake installed on your system. Then "cargo run".</p>
<p>After running, you'll be prompted whether you'd like to host or not. If you say yes, follow by connecting to yourself on 0.0.0.0::your_port.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>Use wsad or arrow keys to move and rotate pieces.</p>
<p>If you're playing with other people, you'll see the next pieces of your "neighbors" above and below your own next piece. You can offer to swap your next piece for one of theirs by pressing E or C to move the next piece target (the shadow piece behind the colored piece). If another player wants to swap with you, their piece will pop out to the right a bit. Move the shadow piece to the popped-out piece to initiate the swap.</p>
<p>You can rotate your view by pressing F (to rotate right) or CAPS (to rotate left).</p>
